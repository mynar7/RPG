            <p>The sun begins to set as you trek through the lush forest of Nerdim on the road to Fandalin. Weary from travel, you rub your tired eyes and look ahead for a place to make camp for the night. You hope to see the soft light of a tavern or inn in the distance, but are unable to see any signs of civilization yet. The forest is dense and vast, and your journey through it has passed days in number and stretched to weeks. Listening to your own footfalls on the beaten path, you begin to reflect on your reasons for braving the forest road on foot instead of by faster means of travel.</p>
            <p>Lost in thought, you neglect the sound of a second set of footfalls shadowing your own. By the time you realize that someone has gotten the drop on you, it's too late. You are struck from behind by a heavy, blunt object, and the blow to the head renders you unconscious. </p>
