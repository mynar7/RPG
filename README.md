## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project I set out to make a turn-based role playing game similar to JRPGs from the 90's. The game has an active time battle system with each character having their own speed stat that controls how often they can perform an action. Each character also has unique moves based off of their individual stats.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game begins with some exposition to set up the reason for why the characters must fight each other, as well as the main antagonist. Afterward the player chooses which character to play as, and then battles the remaining three characters before fighting the boss character. Each character has a unique story that is presented when the character wins or losses.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle system for the game is roughly based off of Gary Gygax's D&D system of using dice roll's to determine hits/misses and damage. For example, when performing a basic attack, a dice roll contrasted against the defending characters armor class (AC) determines whether or not an attack lands, and on a successful attack, the attacker rolls a damage dice plus a damage bonus to determine the amount of damage dealt.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle system also borrows some characteristics of older Final Fantasy titles, having stats like Hit Points, Magic Points, Skill points, and attacks that consume those stats when performed. This adds an element of resource management into the game so that a player must alternate attacks at the right time to be successful.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to dealing damage, there are various moves that inflict status ailments like poison or stun, and some that benefit the character by healing, removing ailments, increasing stats, etc.
